// The function `createNode` dynamically allocates memory for a new binary tree node and initializes its value.
// It returns a pointer to the newly created node.
TreeNode* createNode(int data) {
    // Allocate memory for a new TreeNode

    // Check if the allocation was successful

    // Initialize the node's data and set its left and right children to NULL

    // Return the pointer to the new node
}

// This is a warmup exercise.
// In-order traversal visits the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
// The function `inorderTraversal` prints the data of each node in the tree in in-order.
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    // ...
    printf("%d\n", root->data);
    // ...

// Pre-order traversal visits the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
// The function `preorderTraversal` prints the data of each node in the tree in pre-order.

// The function `freeTree` frees the memory allocated for the binary tree.
// It recursively frees the left and right subtrees and then frees the current node.

// Step 3: free the current node.

// The function `createTree` creates a binary tree from an array representation.
// Hint: You can create a helper function to recursively build the tree.
// Step 1: base case, return NULL. What is the base case?

// Step 3: recursively create the left and right subtrees.
// Step 4: return the created node.

// trimTree function:
// Given a binary tree where each node contains a non-negative integer and two integers, `low` and `high`, 
// your task is to trim the tree such that every root-to-leaf path in the resulting tree has a sum within the inclusive range [low, high]. 
// Specifically, any *leaf* node whose path sum from the root to that leaf falls outside this range should be removed from the tree. 
// If removing a leaf node causes its parent to become a leaf and its new path sum also falls outside the valid range, that parent should be removed as well. 
// This process should continue recursively until all remaining root-to-leaf paths satisfy the constraint.
// The structure of the remaining nodes must be preserved, and the final tree must still be a valid binary tree. 
// Your function should return the root of the trimmed tree.
TreeNode* trimTree(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
    // Hint 1: You need to keep track of the sum of the path from the root to the current node. You can do this by creating a helper function.
    // Hint 2: In your helper function, check if the current node is a leaf node. If it is, check if the sum of the path from the root to this leaf node is within the range [low, high].
    // Hint 3: When you remove a node, do not forget to free the memory allocated for that node.
}

// The function `toBST` converts a binary tree into a binary search tree (BST) by pruning subtrees that violate BST properties. 
// The transformation must ensure that for every node:
// - All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the current node.
// - All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the current node.
// **Restrictions**: The root node must remain unchanged. If a node's value violates BST properties relative to all its ancestors, its entire subtree is removed.
TreeNode* toBST(TreeNode* root) {
    // Hint1: You need to keep track of the minimum and maximum values allowed for each node in the tree. You can do this by creating a helper function.
    // Hint2: In your helper function, check if the current node's value is within the valid range. If it is not, remove the subtree rooted at this node.
    // Hint3: When you remove a node, do not forget to free the memory allocated for that subtree.
